# AHK Folder Icon Changer

## Description
This AutoHotkey script automates the process of customizing folder icons in Windows 10 and 11. It iterates through all subdirectories in the current Explorer window and opens each folder's properties dialog to customize the folder icon. Using UI Automation via the UIA_Interface library, the script navigates the properties window to select and apply a new icon automatically.

The script is designed to streamline repetitive tasks, making it easier to update folder icons across multiple directories with just a hotkey press.
